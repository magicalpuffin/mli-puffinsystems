## Overview

The [Moonlander MK I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) is a $400 dollar ortholinear split keyboard from ZSA, and was my first introduction to the mechanical keyboard world. Despite the impressive marketing, the Moonlander is mediocre at best; the greatest value it provides is for beginners to get into split mechanical keyboards.

UPDATE: The newly released [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) outclasses the Moonlander and addresses many of its issues.

If your top priority is ergonomics, I would recommend a 36 or 42 key keyboard ([Piantor](https://github.com/beekeeb/piantor), [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep)). These keyboard can be purchased pre-soldered and will likely similar in quality to the Moonlander. Many of these keyboards support [Vial](https://get.vial.today/), which enables real time layout configuration.

## Reliability Issues

Within 3 days of receiving my Moonlander, the right board stopped responding when connected. The left board could be used by itself, however, it would stop working the moment the right board was plugged in.

This was caused by unplugging the TRRS cable while boards were still powered. This is actually a [common issue ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/rt083u/) for split keyboards without additional protections built in. This use case and functionality is also advertised by ZSA. 

Fortunately, I was able to contact ZSA and receive a replacement unit. The long lead time also applied to the replacement unit which took about a week to receive.

## Ergonomic Issues

One of the greatest disappointments with the Moonlander was the lackluster ergonomics given its price point and marketing.

The worst offender is thumb cluster. Out of the 4 keys, only one is usable; all of the other keys are too far away to be used without thumb pain. Almost no other keyboard has such a far away thumb cluster, see comparison with the Ferris Sweep (image from [Split Keyboard Compare](https://compare.splitkb.com/)).

Tenting is also dependent on the thumb cluster; therefore, when you fully tent the Moonlander, the thumb cluster is moved even further away and at a downward angle. To address this, you would either have to give ZSA another $112 for the [Platform](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/platform/), or 3d print work arounds such as a [thumb cluster leg](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4688862). 

The pinky columns are not staggered far enough, however, this is a common issue on many keyboards. Trying to reliably press "q" and "p" was difficult and required shifting my entire hand.

I'm surprised these issues were missed when the layout was designed. Looking back at the reviews, I should have also paid more attention to these issues as well.

## How I Used the Moonlander

I purchased the Moonlander for multiple reasons. First reason was ergonomics; I had issues with wrist pain on other keyboards and saw positive online reviews for the Moonlander ([Ben Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSiF7IwOyFw), [Semag Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Big80AStHSU)). Second reason was convenience; many of the other keyboards discussed online were custom made and had fewer keys.

Over the period of 2 months, I iterated on various keyboard layouts, eventually creating a 36 key layout.

Learning ortholinear layout took the longest. Took around 2 months to get used to the keyboard

Some things I learned
- RGB doesn't matter. I used it to differentiate between layers but now I just disabled it completely.
- The wrist rests caused more problems. It is better to just hover your hands over the keyboard. Even with a 36 key layout, I need to constantly move my hands around to reach all of the keys.
- Don't use the thumb cluster. A 36 key layout is able to fully fit on the main board, allowing you to use normal keys for thumb keys.
- Key caps should just be blank. Having printed letters just became annoying whenever you rebinded the buttons

Wrist rests weren't that useful. They positioned your wrist too low which ended up being not ergonomic. In order to press all of the buttons, I had to constantly move around my hand anyways so it was better to just hover my hands over the keyboard instead, making the wrist rests redundant
