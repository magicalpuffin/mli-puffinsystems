## Overview

The [Moonlander MK I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) is a $400 dollar ortholinear split keyboard from ZSA, and was my first introduction to the mechanical keyboard world. Despite the impressive marketing, the Moonlander is mediocre at best; the greatest value it provides is for beginners to get into split mechanical keyboards.

UPDATE: The newly released [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) outclasses the Moonlander and addresses many of its issues.

If your top priority is ergonomics, I would recommend a 36 or 42 key keyboard ([Piantor](https://github.com/beekeeb/piantor), [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep)). These keyboard can be purchased pre-soldered and will likely similar in quality to the Moonlander. Many of these keyboards support [Vial](https://get.vial.today/), which enables real time layout configuration.

## Reliability Issues

Within 3 days of receiving my Moonlander, the right board stopped responding when connected. The left board could be used by itself, however, it would stop working the moment the right board was plugged in.

This was caused by unplugging the TRRS cable while boards were still powered. This is actually a [common issue ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/rt083u/) for split keyboards without additional protections built in. This use case and functionality is also advertised by ZSA. 

Fortunately, I was able to contact ZSA and receive a replacement unit. The long lead time also applied to the replacement unit which took about a week to recieve.

## Ergonomic Issues

One of the greatest disappointments with the Moonlander was the lackluster ergonomics given its price point.

The worst offender is thumb cluster. It is simply too far away to be used reliably, only the closest key can be used reliably without thumb pain. In the image, compare the Ferris Sweep thumb keys with the Moonlander. The larger thumb key is basically unusuable.

Tenting is dependent on the thumb cluster, therefore, if you fully tent the moonlander, the thumb cluster becomes even further away. The work around was to 3d print another leg but this isn't an ideal solution

The pinky columns are not offset far enough. This made pressing "q" and "p" difficult. This would require moving my entire hand in order to access them

Wrist rests weren't that useful. They positioned your wrist too low which ended up being not ergonomic. In order to press all of the buttons, I had to constantly move around my hand anyways so it was better to just hover my hands over the keyboard instead, making the wrist rests redundant


## Learning a Ortholinear Keyboard

The biggest hurdle to most split ortholinear keyboards will likely be breaking all of the bad habits from. It took me around a month to get back to normal typing speed

Also, don't switch away from QWERTY to an alternate layout such as DVORAK while learning an split ortholinear layout. This 

I planed on continuing to use the standard QWERTY layout despite its flaws primarily because it would be easier to learn. There were also other reasons such as:

- Preserving the ability to use other keyboards such as ones on laptops
- Keeping the default key bindings and righthand home row when using Vim
- Using the bumps on the "f" and "j" keys for find the home row

Despite still using the layout I was used to, the ortholinear design was enough to throw off my typing. This was almost entirely due to the bad typing habits I had; this gets punished far more severely when using a split ortholiniear design. Some bad habits include:

- Trying to pressing the "b" key with the right hand
- Pressing "b" instead of "v"
- Using the middle finger for "u" instead of the index
- Pressing "x" with the middle finger instead of the ring
- Pressing "c" with the index finger instead of the middle

## The Good

I purchased the Moonlander for multiple reasons. First reason was ergonomics; I had issues with wrist pain on other keyboards and saw positive online reviews for the Moonlander ([Ben Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSiF7IwOyFw), [Semag Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Big80AStHSU)). Second reason was convenience; many of the other keyboards discussed online were custom made and had fewer keys.
