## Overview

The [ZSA Moonlander MK I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) is a $400 dollar ortholinear split keyboard and is my first mechanical keyboard. Despite the impressive marketing by ZSA, the Moonlander isn't very good; the greatest value it provides is for beginners to get into split mechanical keyboards.

UPDATE: The newly released [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) outclasses the Moonlander and addresses many of its issues.

As someone who suffers from wrist pain, I decided to purchase the Moonlander based on online reviews

Recently I decided to waste an excessive amount of money on a new mechanical keyboard. I was interested in ergonomic split keyboard designs and ended up buying the Moonlander MKI from ZSA.

## Reliability Issues
The Moonlander seems to have some reliability issues. After around 3 days, the left and right board would no longer connect with each other. The left board could be used by itself, however, it would stop working the moment the right board was plugged in. 

ZSA provides warranty for the first two years which covered my replacement unit. The replacement Moonlander does not include key caps but did include key switches (likely required for them to tested the board). The long lead time also applied to the replacement which took about a week.


Board shorted within the first 3 days
## Learning a Ortholinear Keyboard


I planed on continuing to use the standard QWERTY layout despite its flaws primarily because it would be easier to learn. There were also other reasons such as:

- Preserving the ability to use other keyboards such as ones on laptops
- Keeping the default key bindings and righthand home row when using Vim
- Using the bumps on the "f" and "j" keys for find the home row

Despite still using the layout I was used to, the ortholinear design was enough to throw off my typing. This was almost entirely due to the bad typing habits I had; this gets punished far more severely when using a split ortholiniear design. Some bad habits include:

- Trying to pressing the "b" key with the right hand
- Pressing "b" instead of "v"
- Using the middle finger for "u" instead of the index
- Pressing "x" with the middle finger instead of the ring
- Pressing "c" with the index finger instead of the middle
