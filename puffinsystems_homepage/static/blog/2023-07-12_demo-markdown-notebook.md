## Overview

Demo Markdown Notebook was created to demonstrate how Svelte could be used to create a basic note taking app which rendered text into markdown. This is a static site / single page app with no backend. All notebooks are stored in local storage.

This project was rendered using the static adapter for Svelte. Files were deployed to AWS S3 as a static site.

## Objective

The primary objective of the demo markdown notebook project was to create learn Svelte while creating a project beyond basic tutorials.

Looking back at my commits, I started this project in 2023-05-18 and completed it on 2023-05-29. At that point in time, I had very little JS and Svelte experience. As a result, many aspects and concepts used for this project were borrowed from this tutorial:

## Key Libraries and Packages

Considering this is basically my first Svelte project I have more thoughts here than other projects.

### Svelte/Svelte Kit

The Javascript framework used was Svelte/Svelte Kit. Svelte was extremely easy to pick up and a much better frontend compared to Django (what I had used for projects up to this point).

Using Typescript was quite powerful, for large and complex projects it is a necessity. However, the initial setup was bit annoying. It was quite common to get Typescript errors due to missing a types package or a vscode issue.

### Tailwindcss

Initially I didn't understand Tailwind, especially when compared to Bootstrap which provided complete components; however, after using it, it became clear how invaluable the customization and flexibility was. I can't see myself making a project without it.

Although it results in unwieldy html classes, it basically means you don't have to deal with CSS. The classes provided allow for uniformity between components without having define some of global styles.

Tailwind also provides great typography which was useful when rendering markdown.

### Ace Editor

Ace was a code editor which could be used for editing markdown. Although an existing svelte ace package did exist, I decided to implement the component myself for practice. Svelte doesn't have a large package ecosystem, so it common to create your own component for an existing JS package.

The documentation for Ace was sparse, making it annoying to use. For this purpose, there were also better markdown editors available.

### Marked

Used for rendering text to markdown

### Dompurify

Used to sanitize the html generated by marked
