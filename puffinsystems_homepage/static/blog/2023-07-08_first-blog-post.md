Hello world! This is the first blog post. I'll use this post to generally describe what I intend on posting as well as testing some markdown featrues.

## How this blog works

This website was created using **Svelte** and hosted as a static site using **AWS** and **SST**. These blog posts are markdown files which are fetched and rendered.

| Stack              | Dependency         |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| JS Framework       | Svelte             |
| Hosting            | AWS                |
| CSS Framework      | Tailwind           |
| Markdown Rendering | Marked, DOM Purify |

> What will you write about?

I plan on writing blog posts for the following:

- Details about personal projects. In the future I could link to a blog post whenever I'm explaining a project.
- Tutorials and guides. Maybe some `python` or `svelte` related guides. It would be hepful for others as well as myself to have it online.
- Thoughts about things I find interesting. I guess this can basically mean anything.
